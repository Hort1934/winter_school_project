### 🌟 Project description

Blizhni is a project created to support vulnerable people, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, by organising help from volunteers. Each volunteer receives social points for completing tasks, which is an innovative reward system. These points can be used to receive benefits or discounts from organisations that recognise social points. The tasks are created by vulnerable people and their status is confirmed through government agencies, which guarantees transparency. The project also integrates with government databases to automatically check user statuses and facilitate the registration process.
